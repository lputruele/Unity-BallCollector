# Unity-BallCollector
 Simple game project for PC and Android.

 This is my first Unity project. I plan to document my learning experience through my upcoming Unity projects

 Learning Log:

 * I experimented with some design patterns (e.g. singletons and static classes) as well as familiarizing with built-in Unity patterns such as Component, Update, and Events.
 * The arquitecture might be messy but for now I prefer to leave it that way and delegate improvements to future projects.
 
 Possible improvements:
 
 * Using an Object Pool pattern for falling items to improve performance.
 * Using a Service Locator pattern instead of singletons or static classes for 'Managers'.
